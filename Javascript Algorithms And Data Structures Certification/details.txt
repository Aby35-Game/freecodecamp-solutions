1) Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope.
2) Variables can contain alphabets,number $ and _ but cannot start with a number.
3) js objects can contain number and strings and if it's single word or number quotes("") are not mandatory.
4) . and [] notation to access objects properties.
	Cases where bracket notation rescues us
	a) when the property is created or added on the fly and not been defined in the first assignment.
	b) when the key contains space 
	c) The key name is stored in a variable.
5) jsonObj.hasOwnProperty check in javascript object whether such key is presenet or not in object.
6) Math.random() generate a floating number between 0 and 1 excluding 1.
   Math.floor is used to round off a number to nearest whole number
	Math.floor(Math.random()*10) will generate single digit integer number between 0 and 10 (10 is exclusive)
	Math.floor((Math.random()*(max-min+1))+min); will generate a random number between min and max (inclusive both).
7) The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. It takes a second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the 	number in the string. The radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.
    
   The function call looks like:
   parseInt(string, radix);
